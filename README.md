# simple-package-manager
I just want to be able to fetch libraries I commonly use and generate VS .sln/project files with everything hooked up. Premake doesn't do most of this without a significant amount of custom work anyway.

EDIT: I would just like to apologize to premake, this is actually really hard and I'll probably just use premake for making the sln/project files.
